# CSC207-Project1
This is the git hub repository for our CSC207 project

The project domain is Task Management Software for UofT Students and Professors.

The idea is to build a program where professors can upload exam, quiz and assignment dates along with their description and their students will recieve them. This would ensure that students have a centralized system where they can keep track of all their assignents, exams and quizzes all on centralized platform.

The API that we are planning on using is the JIRA API. The link: https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/rest-apis/.

According to the documentation, the API allows users to access projects, check their progress, create and distribute projects. The projects can be thought of as exams, quizzes, and tests that are distributed to the students, and the students can get summary of the project. The JIRA API can be used in that regard.

The JIRA API will allow us to contact the Server application, which we can leverage to our advantage, as it can help us store, retrieve and distribute the assignments.

List of Technical Problems that we might face:
  1) Getting the API itself to work
  2) Re-formatting project to Exam, Assignment and Quiz types
  3) Managing the acess levels for the two types of users: Students and Professors
