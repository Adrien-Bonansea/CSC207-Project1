To get a CSV file from google cloud (changes must me made based on our stuff):
          StorageOptions options = 
          StorageOptions.newBuilder().setProjectId(GCP_PROJECT_ID)
                  .setCredentials(gcsConfig.getCredentials()).build();
          Storage storage = options.getService();
          Blob blob = storage.get(BUCKET_NAME, FILE_NAME);
          ReadChannel readChannel = blob.reader();
          BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(Channels.newReader(readChannel, "UTF-8"));
